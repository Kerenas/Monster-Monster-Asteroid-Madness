.SH SYNOPSIS

.B void (*adime_callback)(DIALOG *d)
.SH DESCRIPTION
If you set this to something else than `NULL\', then that function will be
called continuously as long as a Adime dialog is open. The argument `d\'
will point to the first object of the current Adime dialog, or the first
object of Allegro\'s file selector when it\'s open. See
adime/examples/exanim.c for an example on how to use this to do animation
while a dialog is open.
