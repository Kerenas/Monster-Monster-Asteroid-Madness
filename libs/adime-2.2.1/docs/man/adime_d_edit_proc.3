.SH NAME
adime_d_edit_proc
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <adime.h>

.sp
.B int adime_d_edit_proc(int msg, DIALOG *d, int c)
.SH DESCRIPTION
Like Allegro\'s `d_edit_proc()\', but with 3d-ish style. Note that the 3d
border is three pixels wide, so you have to add those pixels to the size
of the edit box. It also adds an extra feature: The `d->d1\' field, if
positive, is the maximal number of characters, just like with
d_edit_proc(). But you may also set it to be negative, meaning that (after
removing the sign) it is the maximal number of bytes occupied by the
string, including the trailing zero. (This may be different from the
number of characters when you use Unicode.)
