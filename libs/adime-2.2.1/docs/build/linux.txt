                         Installation Notes for Linux

                               by Sven Sandberg



==============================================
======== Basic Installation Procedure ========
==============================================

Run the following commands in the shell:

   ./fix.sh unix
   make all
   make installall

(The first command tells the installation program that you use
Linux. The second compiles the library, examples and
documentation. The third copies essential files to common
directories.)



======================================
======== Installation Options ========
======================================

The basic installation procedure compiles both the optimized library
(for releasing your program) and the debugging library (for developing
your program).

Compiling statically linked libraries:
   Add "STATICLINK=1" to the command line, both for "make all" and
   "make installall".

Compiling only the optimized library:
   Run "make" and "make install" instead of "make all" and "make
   installall", respectively.

Compiling only the debugging library: 
   Add "DEBUGMODE=1" to the command line. Do it both for "make" and
   for "make install".

Installing to a different location:
   If you want "make installall" to put the libraries in <DIR>/lib
   rather than /usr/local/lib, then add SYSTEM_DIR=<DIR> to the
   command line.
		 
Installing info and man documentation:
   Run "make install-info" and/or "make install-man". You may conserve
   some space by running "make install-gzipped-info" and/or
   "make install-gzipped-man" instead.


=======================
======== Usage ========
=======================

Including Adime's header files:
   #include <adime.h>

Linking:
   Add "-ladime" to gcc's command line when linking your program. Note
   that "-ladime" must come before "-lalleg".

   Use "-ladimed" instead of "-ladime" if you want to link with the
   debugging library.

Viewing the documentation:
   Run "info adime" to view it with info. (This only works after you
   have run "install-info" or "install-gzipped-info".)

   Run "man adime" to view the man pages. (This only works after you
   have run "install-man" or "install-gzipped-man".)

   If you prefer html, open adime/docs/html/adime.html in your
   favourite browser.

   If you prefer plain text, open adime/docs/txt/adime.txt in your
   favourite text viewer.
