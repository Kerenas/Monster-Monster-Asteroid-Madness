                       Installation Notes for DOS/DJGPP

                               by Sven Sandberg



==============================================
======== Basic Installation Procedure ========
==============================================

Run the following commands in the DOS shell:

   fix djgpp
   make all
   make installall

(The first command tells the installation program that you use
DJGPP. The second compiles the library, examples and
documentation. The third copies essential files to common
directories.)



======================================
======== Installation Options ========
======================================

The basic installation procedure compiles both the optimized library
(for releasing your program) and the debugging library (for developing
your program).

Compiling only the optimized library: 
   Run "make" and "make install" instead of "make all" and "make
   installall", respectively.

Compiling only the debugging library: 
   Add "DEBUGMODE=1" to the command line. Do it both for "make" and
   for "make install".

Compressing the exe's:
   To recover some disk space, run
   "make compress UPX_PROGRAM=<program>". Here, <program> is the
   location of upx.exe, e.g., c:\tools\upx.exe. This will use UPX
   (see http://upx.sf.net) to compress the example's executable files.



=======================
======== Usage ========
=======================

Including Adime's header files:
   #include <adime.h>

Linking (in RHIDE):
   Go to the "Options / Libraries" menu, and add "adime" BEFORE
   "alleg". If "alleg" is on the first line, then you must move it
   down. Don't forget to check the boxes next to "adime" and "alleg".

   Use "adimd" instead of "adime" if you want to link with the
   debugging library.

Linking (command line):
   Add "-ladime" to gcc's command line when linking your program. Note
   that "-ladime" must come before "-lalleg".

   Use "-ladimd" instead of "-ladime" if you want to link with the
   debugging library.

Viewing the documentation:
   In RHIDE, go to the "Help / Syntax help / Files to search" menu,
   and add "adime" after the existing "libc" entry (separated by a
   space).

   Open docs/html/adime.html in your favourite browser, or
   docs/chm/adime.chm in windows help viewer.
