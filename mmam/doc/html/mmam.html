<h1>Monster Monster Asteroid Maddness</h1>

<P>

Monster Monster Asteroid Maddness is a game all about collecting, raising, buying, selling
monsters for your asteroid to make it the best tourist location in the galaxy.
Your home asteroid takes a rather erratic orbit through the asteroid belt and gets close enough
to the other asteroids to open a jump gate that you can take your ship through for a short time.
During this time you can collect monsters with your grappling claw and tranquilizer darts.  Either
way you should tire them out a bit if they are rather large otherwise they will break out of your
on board cage.   Some monsters are harmless, but some will try to actively attack your ship.  Once
you successfully get a monster back to your asteroid it is up to you to keep them fed.  Some types
of monsters either don't get along with other monsters or eat your other monsters so you also have to
maintain their enclosures.  Some of the more violent monsters can be tamed by being fed.  It is up to
you to observe how different monsters interact.

<h2> Your Ship</h2>
A Hover Ship equipped with a multi-gun and a grappler claw launcher.  And it comes with 3 cages.
It starts out kinda sucky honestly, but you can buy/find upgrades.

<h2> The Monsters</h2>
There are big ones.  There are little ones.  There are red ones.  There are blue ones.

<h2> Pit Fights</h2>
you can train yor monters in pit fights.


<h2> J-Mart Asteroids </h2>
Sells all sorts of upgrades, enclosures, darts for reasonable prices.

<h2> Buddy's Fried Chicken Asteroids </h2>
Their slogan is "for $2 it doesn't even need to be chicken."  These places will
buy monsters for <em> undisclosed </em> reasons.


<h2> Arena Asteroids </h2>
Usually have all sorts of competitions to gamble on.  You also can enter your monsters
into these things for prize money and the title of the <strong> Toughest Monster in the
Galaxy</strong>.   Doing well in one of the competitions increased the fame of your
asteroid.


<h2> Roaming Merchants </h2>
These guys travel all over the galaxy buying and selling stuff.   Occasionally
they come up with some stuff you "just can't buy at J-Mart".  Some of them are kinda
shifty though.

<h2> Tourists </h2>
They pay a fixed fee to fly around your asteroid and look at all the monsters.
The more impressive your monster collection the more tourests you will attract.

<h2> Raiders </h2>
They attack stuff for fun.  In other words they are bastards.

<h2> Hunters </h2>
You can optionally set up a hunting ground on your asteroid.  There is only an entry fee, so
you should consider this carefully.  If they get eaten you get their stuff.

<h2> Alien Artifacts </h2>
Can you find the amazing four alien artifacts?  I bet you can't.  But if you'd like to try...
