@header Monster Monster Asteroid Maddness
    Monster Monster Asteroid Maddness is a game all about collecting, raising, buying, and selling
monsters for your asteroid to make it the best tourist location in the galaxy.
Your home asteroid takes a rather erratic orbit through the asteroid belt and gets close enough
to the other asteroids to open a jump gate that you can take your ship through for a short time.
During this time you can collect monsters with your grappling claw and tranquilizer darts.  Either
way you should tire them out a bit if they are rather large otherwise they will break out of your
onboard cage.

@header Your Ship
    A Hover Ship equipped with a multi-gun and a grappler claw launcher.  And it comes with 3 cages.
It starts out kinda sucking honestly, but you can buy/find upgrades.

@img BASEF_JPG
@header Your Base
    Your asteroid base has access to all your park's settings including: ticket prices,
graphs of everything, your employee hire screen and lost of other useful stuff.  The asteroid
base broad also works there and she can order you new cages and a few other useful things.
She also thinks she knows how to run a Monster Park (you might want to listen to her).


@header The Monsters
    There are big ones.  There are little ones.  There are red ones.  There are blue ones.
Some monsters are harmless, but others will try to actively attack your ship.  Once
you successfully get a monster back to your asteroid it is up to you to keep it fed.  Some types
of monsters either don't get along with other monsters or eat your other monsters so you also have to
maintain their enclosures.  Some of the more violent monsters can be tamed by being fed.  It is up to
you to observe how different monsters interact.

@header Tourists 
    They pay a fixed fee to fly around your asteroid and look at all the monsters.
The more impressive your monster collection the more tourists you will attract.

@header Buddy's Fried Chicken Asteroids
    Their slogan is "for $2 it doesn't even need to be chicken."  These places will
buy monsters for UNDISCLOSED reasons.   You can also buy their chicken and use it as 
substitute critter food to save some of your little animals from getting eaten.

@header Monster Trainers
    You can train your monsters in pit fights.  While your monsters can get a tiny amount
of fame from these duals, the real recognition comes from high level competition at
the arenas run by the fight commission.

@header Arena Asteroids
    Usually have all sorts of competitions to gamble on.  You also can enter your monsters
into these things for prize money and the title of the TOUGHEST MONSTER IN THE
GALAXY.   Doing well in one of the competitions increased the fame of your
asteroid.

@img TRADESHIPF_JPG
@header Roaming Merchants
    These guys travel all over the galaxy buying and selling stuff.   Occasionally
they come up with some stuff you "just can't buy at J-Mart".  Some of them are kinda
shifty though.


@img RAIDER_JPG
@header Raiders 
    They attack stuff for fun.  In other words they are bastards.

@img HUNTER_JPG
@header Hunters 
    You can optionally set up a hunting ground on your asteroid.  There is only an entry fee, so
you should consider this carefully.  If they get eaten you get their stuff.


@header Alien Artifacts 
    Can you find the amazing four alien artifacts?  I bet you can't.  But if you'd like to try...
