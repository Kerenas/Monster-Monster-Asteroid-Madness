Starting with version 0.6 there is network play
added by the optional library libnet.  I don't
have a server that is an "official" public list server yet
my personal internet connection isn't up 24/7 so I don't 
plan to run one.  If someone out there wants to host it
I can be contacted at <missingdialtone@aol.com>
