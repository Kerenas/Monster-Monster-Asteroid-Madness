                           Allegro Dialogs Made Easy

                                   Changes

                               by Sven Sandberg





=================================
============ Changes ============
=================================

From Adime 2.2.0 to 2.2.1:

   Adjusted to Allegro's new prototype for _add_exit_func().

   Fixed issue in MSVC's makefile.


From Adime 2.0.0 to 2.2.0:

   Stijn Wolters ported Adime to Mac OS X. The port features
   installation as framework and template for ProjectBuilder
   and XCode.


From Dime 1.9.1 to Adime 2.0.0:

   Changed the name of the library from Dime to Adime. This was
   necessary because it appeared that a library called Dime already
   exists, is shipped with Debian and installs a libdime.a file.

   Eric Botcazou wrote a Borland C++ port _and_ a QNX port. He also
   fixed several problems in the build process for MinGW32 and MSVC.

   Changed licence to the zlib/libpng licence, after Peter Wang
   convinced me that it's much easier to understand. LGPL is very long
   and complicated, and contains some subtle points that are likely to
   make life harder for users.

   Arranged generated documentation in subdirectories of the docs dir,
   according to the format. Also shipped makedoc with the distribution
   to make it self-contained.

   %string[] and %filename[] now take bytes as the string length, not
   characters. This is much safer, because it is normally the buffer
   length that you want to specify.

   `adime_d_edit_proc()' now understands negative values of d->d1 as
   maximum length in bytes.

   Added `adime_window_visible' flag, which you can use to hide the
   background window.

   Added %buttonrow[] format which allows you to have more buttons
   than just ok and cancel in a dialog. Also wrote an example,
   exbutrow.

   Added %button[] format.

   Fixed bug in %dialogf[] which didn't properly reset the dialog when
   you reopened after ok'ing it.

   All files are now indented using only spaces.

   dlls may now be binary compatible between versions, because
   fixdll.sh tries to do the same thing as Allegro's fixdll.sh, but I
   don't know very much on the issue so I can't tell for sure.

   Added man, chm and devhelp versions of the documentation. Something
   is wrong with the dvi version; otherwise we would also have dvi,
   ps, ps.gz and pdf versions.


From 1.2.4 to 1.9.1:

   Renamed almost all functions. All names are now prefixed with `dime_' (or
   `_dime_' for internals, or `DIME_' for macros, etc.). This means that any
   old code using Dime will almost certainly be broken. I'm very sorry for
   this, but it's a one-time-only change and it is much nicer not to pollute
   the namespace so much. There is a compatibility header, dime/dimecomp.h,
   which you can use until you have updated your code.

   Const-ified the whole library.

   Made it possible to compile Dime even if there is no local copy of the
   Allegro tree available. You just need to get dimalleg.zip utility from the
   homepage, and Dime's makefile magically does the rest for you.

   Made %filename[] take second argument as the number of bytes rather than
   the number of characters used. I hope this doesn't break any code.

   Changed `dime_d_button_proc()' to be able to call a user-specified
   callback. This might break your code if you were using it.

   Fixed bug causing the dialog not to be correctly centered when only
   %nothing[] or %line[] was used.

   Added this entry in the changelog.

   Wrote `dime_file_select()': a 3d version of Allegro's file selector.

   Fixed some bugs that ought to have made the gui procs unusable except when
   used internally by `dime_dialogf()'.

   Added `dime_d_list_proc()'.

   Made the window title look better, added some color variables that you can
   use to control this, and added `dime_d_window_proc()'.

   Fixed bug in `dime_fill_textout()' causing one scanline too much to be
   drawn.

   Fixed bug not restoring text_mode in some cases.

   Rewrote the inner workings of `dime_dialogf()' to be cleaner and more
   flexible, so that the new %chain[] format could be added.

   Removed some stupid limitations on the length of various strings.


From 1.2.2 to 1.2.4:

   Fixed bug causing make to fail with Allegro version >= 3.9.40. Thanks to
   Eric Botcazou for pointing this out only hours after 1.2.2 was released!

   Replaced fixdjgpp.bat, fixming.bat etc by a single fix.sh and fix.bat.

   Fixed compilation problem with gcc 3.* (at least 3.02 for djgpp). Note
   that you should _not_ use 3.02 because it has a bug that generates bad
   code.

   Made version numbering consistent (major.minor.patch, where minor is even
   for releases and odd for unstable working versions).


From 1.2.1 to 1.2.2:

   Fixed bug making "%vlist[x]" crash when x > [size of list].

   Fixed bug causing "make depend" to fail.

   Changed the license: Dime is now distributed under the conditions of
   the GNU Lesser General Public License, LGPL.


From 1.2.1b to 1.2.1:

   Added exanim: an example on how to animate in the background while a
   dialog is open.

   Renamed "%strlist[]" to "%vlist[]". Sorry if I broke any code, but I
   figured Dime is still so young that it won't hurt too much, and the name
   is much more logical. I promise not to do this again unless it's
   absolutely necessary :-)

   Fixed bugs in the example program.

   Fixed bug in the documentation for `dialogf_callback()' and made it be
   called even when a file selector is open.

   Made the expression evaluator understand exponents.

   Mike Greubel provided a winhelp version of the documentation (which is
   available as a separate archive from Dime's homepage) and drew a nice
   logotype.

   Improved some error messages and the Common Problems section of readme.

   Split readme into readme, changes and wishlist, and made expressi.txt be
   generated by the makefile.


From 1.2b to 1.2.1b:

   Fixed a bug in makefile.mgw.

   Actually included the new example program in the distribution.


From 1.1.1b to 1.2b:

   Fixed a bug not restoring text background color in some cases.

   Made the info format documentation install itself to common directories
   under djgpp.

   Improved the example program.

   Peter Wang contributed a Linux port.

   Made the statically linked version of Dime link with Allegro statically.
   (Thanks to Mike Fahlbusch who pointed this out!)


From 1.1b to 1.1.1b:

   Removed a bug that prevented the whole thing from building on other
   machines than mine.


From 1.0 to 1.1b:

   No actual changes, really. But 1.0 should have been 1.0 beta, so I
   released 1.1b to make it a beta :-) . Also fixed some version errors in
   the documentation and in dime.h.
