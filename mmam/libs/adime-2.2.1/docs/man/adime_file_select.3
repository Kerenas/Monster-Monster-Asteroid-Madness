adime_file_select
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <adime.h>

.sp
.B int adime_file_select(const char *message, char *path, const char *ext,
.B int size, int w, int h);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Like Allegro\'s `file_select_ex()\', but with Adime\'s 3d look and feel. It
is not affected by all `adime_window_*\' variables though, only the ones
beginning with `adime_window_title_*\'. Also, it has the extra feature of
not changing `path\' if it gets cancelled.
