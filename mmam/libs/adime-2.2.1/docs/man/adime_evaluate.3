adime_evaluate
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <adime.h>

.sp
.B double adime_evaluate(const char *equation, int *error,
.B double (*var)(const char *name));
.SH DESCRIPTION
Helper function for evaluating arithmetic expressions, which may be
useful in your programs even though it isn\'t really logically connected
to the other functions (i.e. it\'s not a gui function). It evaluates the
provided equation, returning the result, and storing a nonzero value in
`error\' if anything goes wrong. If the `var\' function is not NULL, this
will be called whenever a variable is encountered in the expression,
allowing you to look up and return a suitable value for it. For more
information on the expressions, see expressi.txt
