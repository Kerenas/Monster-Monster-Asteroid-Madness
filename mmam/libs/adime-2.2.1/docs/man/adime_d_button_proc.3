adime_d_button_proc
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <adime.h>

.sp
.B int adime_d_button_proc(int msg, DIALOG *d, int c)
.SH DESCRIPTION
Similar to Allegro\'s `d_button_proc()\', but with 3d-ish style. It also has
a slightly different behaviour: Unlike `d_button_proc()\', the D_EXIT flag
has no effect. Instead you need to set the `d1\' field to one of the three
constants:

ADIME_BUTTON_TOGGLE

The button behaves like a check box, i.e. when clicked it toggles
between being in and being out.

ADIME_BUTTON_EXIT

The button exits the dialog when clicked.

ADIME_BUTTON_CALLBACK

If you provide a callback function in the dp2 field, then it will
be called whenever the button is clicked. This callback should have
the form `int my_callback(DIALOG *d)\', and its return value will be
passed back to the dialog manager.
