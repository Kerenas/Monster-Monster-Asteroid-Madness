.SH DESCRIPTION
Function for pretty-printing floating point numbers: The number gets at
most 10 digits to the left of the decimal point, at most 9 to the right
of it, and at most 10 totally. If the absolute value of the number is
>= 10000000000 or < 0.000001, it is written in exponential form
instead. Exponential form has at most 6 digits in the mantissa, so that
the total number of digits never exceeds 9. Does not support Unicode.
