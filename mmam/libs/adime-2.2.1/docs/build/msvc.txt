                           Allegro Dialogs Made Easy

                      Installation Notes for Windows/MSVC

                               by Sven Sandberg



!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
NOTE: I have not been able to test the MSVC version after the last
changes because I don't have access to MSVC. The following may work. I
would very much appreciate if anyone can confirm or deny whether it
works. Of course, any bugfixes give extra kudos.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

==============================================
======== Basic Installation Procedure ========
==============================================

Run the following commands in the DOS shell:

   fix msvc
   make all
   make installall

(The first command tells the installation program that you use
MSVC. The second compiles the library, examples and documentation. The
third copies essential files to common directories.)



======================================
======== Installation Options ========
======================================

NOTE:
I don't have access to MSVC any more so I can't test it. Installation
Options should be the same as under MinGW32, and Usage should be
similar to how you use Allegro, but I haven't confirmed it. Any help
with this would be appreciated!
