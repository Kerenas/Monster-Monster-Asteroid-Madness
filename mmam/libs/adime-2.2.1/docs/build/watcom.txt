                       Installation Notes for DOS/Watcom

                               by Sven Sandberg



==============================================
======== Basic Installation Procedure ========
==============================================

Run the following commands in the DOS shell:

   fix watcom
   make all WATCOM=<watcomdir>
   make installall WATCOM=<watcomdir>

Here, <watcomdir> is the directory where you installed Watcom, e.g.,
c:\watcom.

(The first command tells the installation program that you use
Watcom. The second compiles the library, examples and
documentation. The third copies essential files to common
directories.)



======================================
======== Installation Options ========
======================================

The basic installation procedure compiles both the optimized library
(for releasing your program) and the debugging library (for developing
your program).

Compiling only the optimized library:
   Run "make" and "make install" instead of "make all" and "make
   installall", respectively.

Compiling only the debugging library:
   Add "DEBUGMODE=1" to the command line. Do it both for "make" and
   for "make install".

Compressing the exe's:
   To recover some disk space, run
   "make compress UPX_PROGRAM=<program>".  Here, <program> is the
   location of upx.exe, e.g., c:\tools\upx.exe.  This will use UPX
   (see http://upx.sf.net) to compress the example's executable files.



=======================
======== Usage ========
=======================

Including Adime's header files:
   #include <adime.h>

Linking (command line):
   Add "library adime" to wlink's command line when linking your
   program.

   Use "adimd" instead of "adime" if you want to link with the
   debugging library.

Viewing the documentation:
   Open docs/html/adime.html in your favourite browser, or
   docs/chm/adime.chm in windows help viewer.
