                    Installation Notes for Windows/MinGW32

                               by Sven Sandberg



==============================================
======== Basic Installation Procedure ========
==============================================

Make sure that you don't have DJGPP's tools in your path. Then run the
following commands in the DOS shell:

   fix mingw32
   make all MINGDIR=<mingdir>
   make installall MINGDIR=<mingdir>

Here, <mingdir> is the directory where you installed MinGW32, e.g.,
c:\mingw32.

(The first command tells the installation program that you use
MinGW32. The second compiles the library, examples and
documentation. The third copies essential files to common
directories.)



======================================
======== Installation Options ========
======================================

The basic installation procedure compiles both the optimized library
(for releasing your program) and the debugging library (for developing
your program).

Compiling statically linked libraries:
   Add "STATICLINK=1" to the command line, both for "make all" and
   "make installall".

Compiling only the optimized library:
   Run "make" and "make install" instead of "make all" and "make
   installall", respectively.

Compiling only the debugging library:
   Add "DEBUGMODE=1" to the command line. Do it both for "make" and
   for "make install".

Compressing the dll's and exe's:
   To recover some disk space, run
   "make compress UPX_PROGRAM=<program>". Here, <program> is the
   location of upx.exe, e.g., c:\tools\upx.exe. This will use UPX (see
   http://upx.sf.net) to compress the example's executable files and
   the optimized dll. Note that you have to do this before "make
   install" if you want the compressed dll to be copied to the windows
   directory: if Adime's dll already is there, the new one will not be
   copied.



=======================
======== Usage ========
=======================

Including the header files:
   #include <adime.h>

Linking (command line):
   Add "-ladime" to gcc's command line. Note that "-ladime" must come
   before "-lalleg".

   Use "-ladimed" instead of "-ladime" if you want to link with the
   debugging library.

Linking (Dev-CPP):
   TODO

   Open docs/html/adime.html in your favourite browser, or
   docs/chm/adime.chm in windows help viewer.
