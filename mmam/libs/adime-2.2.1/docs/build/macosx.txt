==============================================
======== Basic Installation Procedure ========
==============================================

Run the following commands in the shell:

   ./fix.sh macosx
   make all
   sudo make installall

(The first command tells the installation program that you use
Mac OS X. The second compiles the library, examples and
documentation. The third copies essential files to common
directories.)

Optionally you can install Adime as framework and template for
ProjectBuilder (XCode):

   sudo make install-framework or
   sudo make install-framework EMBED=1 , for the embedded framework
   sudo make install-template

Please note: if you have build Allegro as embedded framework you 
have to build Adime as embedded framework as well, otherwise you
will not be able to build application which use Adime.

======================================
======== Installation Options ========
======================================

The basic installation procedure compiles both the optimized library
(for releasing your program) and the debugging library (for developing
your program).

Compiling statically linked libraries:
   Enter "export STATICLINK=1" before "make all" and 
   "sudo make installall".

Compiling only the optimized library:
   Run "make" and "sudo make install" instead of "make all" and 
   "sudo make installall", respectively.

Compiling only the debugging library: 
   Enter "export DEBUGMODE=1" before "make" and 
   "sudo make install".

Installing to a different location:
   If you want "sudo make installall" to put the libraries in 
   <DIR>/lib rather than /usr/local/lib, then add 
   SYSTEM_DIR=<DIR> to the command line.
		 
Installing info and man documentation:
   Run "sudo make install-info" and/or "sudo make install-man". You 
   may conserve some space by running "sudo make install-gzipped-info" 
   and/or "sudo make install-gzipped-man" instead.


=======================
======== Usage ========
=======================

Including Adime's header files:
   #include <adime.h>

Linking:
   Add "-ladime" to gcc's command line when linking your program. Note
   that "-ladime" must come before "-lalleg".

   Use "-ladimd" instead of "-ladime" if you want to link with the
   debugging library.

   Use "-ladimd_s" or "-ladime_s" if you want to link with the
   static library.
   
   Use "-framework Adime" of you want to link with the framework.

Creating a (stand-alone) application-bundle:
   Install Allegro and Adime as (embedded) framework using:
      
      sudo make install-framework or
      sudo make install-framework EMBED=1
      
      link with: `allegro-config --frameworks` -framework Adime
      
      run 'fixbundle' (without parameters to see options)
      
      copy Adime's framework into the application-bundle with CpMac, i.e.:
   
      CpMac -r /Library/Frameworks/Adime.framework/   
         MyProgram.app/Contents/Frameworks/   

   You can find 'fixbundle' in the Allegro directory: tools/macosx/
   You can find 'CpMac' in /Developer/Tools/
   
   In case you build your application with ProjectBuilder or XCode:
   
      - you don't have to use 'fixbundle' since an application-
        bundle already exists.
        
      - it is possible that the 'Frameworks' directory doesn't exist,
        in that case you have to create it manually and then copy the
        frameworks as described (you will have to perform this
        operation for both, Allegro.framework and Adime.framework).
      
Viewing the documentation:
   Run "info adime" to view it with info. (This only works after you
   have run "install-info" or "install-gzipped-info".)

   Run "man adime" to view the man pages. (This only works after you
   have run "install-man" or "install-gzipped-man".)

   If you prefer html, open adime/docs/html/adime.html in your
   favourite browser.

   If you prefer plain text, open adime/docs/txt/adime.txt in your
   favourite text viewer.

   
=======================
======== Notes ========
=======================

If you want to know more about the use of frameworks and Allegro/Adime,
you might want to take a look at 'docs/build/macosx.txt' in the Allegro
directory.
