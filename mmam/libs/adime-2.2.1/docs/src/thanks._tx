Authors
<ul>
   Eric Botcazou (<email>ebotcazou@libertysurf.fr</a>).<ul>
      Ported the whole thing both to QNX and to Borland C++. Contributed
      fixes to the MinGW32 and MSVC ports as well.
</ul>
   Mike Fahlbusch (<email>mcf@cobweb.com.au</a>).<ul>
      Provided some useful bug reports.
</ul>
   Mike Greubel (<email>mike.greubel@pro-entertain.de</a>).<ul>
      Provided a winhelp version of the documentation.
</ul>
   Peter Wang (<email>tjaden@alphalink.com.au</a>).<ul>
      Ported the library to Linux/Unix.
</ul>
   Shawn Hargreaves (<email>shawn@talula.demon.co.uk</a>).<ul>
      Wrote the expression evaluator. It was originally written for EGG (see
      http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/egg/) but was pinched it out since it is
      so useful. He is also the main author of Allegro, from which I have
      taken most of the portability code (platform specific makefiles,
      scripts and headers), and some C code as well.
</ul>
   Stijn Wolters (<email>stijnw@xs4all.nl</a>).<ul>
      Ported the library to Mac OS X (special thanks to Angelo Mottola for 
      all help and tips).
</ul>
   Sven Sandberg (<email>svens@it.uu.se</a>).<ul>
      Wrote everything that wasn't written by somebody else.
</ul>
