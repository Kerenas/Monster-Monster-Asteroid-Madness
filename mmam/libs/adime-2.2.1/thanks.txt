============ Authors ============
=================================

   Eric Botcazou (ebotcazou@libertysurf.fr).
      Ported the whole thing both to QNX and to Borland C++. Contributed
      fixes to the MinGW32 and MSVC ports as well.

   Mike Fahlbusch (mcf@cobweb.com.au).
      Provided some useful bug reports.

   Mike Greubel (mike.greubel@pro-entertain.de).
      Provided a winhelp version of the documentation.

   Peter Wang (tjaden@alphalink.com.au).
      Ported the library to Linux/Unix.

   Shawn Hargreaves (shawn@talula.demon.co.uk).
      Wrote the expression evaluator. It was originally written for EGG (see
      http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/egg/) but was pinched it out since it is
      so useful. He is also the main author of Allegro, from which I have
      taken most of the portability code (platform specific makefiles,
      scripts and headers), and some C code as well.

   Stijn Wolters (stijnw@xs4all.nl).
      Ported the library to Mac OS X (special thanks to Angelo Mottola for 
      all help and tips).

   Sven Sandberg (svens@it.uu.se).
      Wrote everything that wasn't written by somebody else.
