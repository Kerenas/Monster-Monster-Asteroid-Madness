adime (allegro dialogues made easy, available on sourceforge)
alpng
libogg
libvorbis

Virtual Machine used:
Boxes

OS used for VM
MX-Linux 32-bit(required to be 32-bit to compile)

Current to/do list:
Convert Alogg mentions in code to Logg OR find a way to properly make all Logg files named as Alogg files
remove sound dependence
make the --without-alogg and --without-dumb arguments for./config function properly
update some code(relies on a 20 year old compiler)

Actually get the game running
